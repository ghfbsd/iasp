.TH TPTTSUB 3
.SH NAME
tpttsub \- subroutine interface to travel time tables using tau-splines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @@FC@@ -o prog.o prog.f @@LIBLOC@@/tpttsub.o
.SH DESCRIPTION
tpttsub.o is a subroutine interface to access the travel times tables for
a wide variety of seismic phases and return values for use in programs.
It is designed to be Fortran callable, but can also be called by C language
routines as well by knowledgeable users.
.PP
There are three main types of access to the tables:
.nf
- to get the travel time for a single arrival at a particular range,
- to get a table of travel times for all arrivals at a particular range,
- to get a table of slowness, range and travel time for a phase,
.fi
plus a few auxiliary routines to choose the velocity model, process phase
names, and to obtain wavespeeds at the source depth.
.PP
There is a default set of tables (@@MODNAM@@) that depends on the
.IR ttimes (1)
package's installation details, but this can be changed through a call to a
subroutine that
.IR tpttsub (3)
provides.
.PP
A list of the subroutines provided by
.IR tpttsub (3)
follows.
.SS tpmod - change travel time tables
Called by
.nf

      call tpmod(\f2module\fP)

.fi
where
.I module
is a character value containing the name of a velocity model.
Subsequent calls to any other subroutines will return values associated with
that model.
.SS tpttsv - obtain source P and S wavespeeds
Called by
.nf

      call tpttsv(\f2depth\fP,\f2vp\fP,\f2vs\fP)

.fi
where
.I depth
is the source depth (km).
The subroutine returns the P and S wavespeeds at the source in
.I vp
and
.IR vs .
.SS tptt - return the travel time for a specific phase
Called as a function by
.nf

      x = tptt(\f2id\fP,\f2delta\fP,\f2depth\fP,\f2dtdd\fP,\f2dtdh\fP)

.fi
where
.I id
is a phase name,
.I delta
is a distance (degrees), and
.I depth
is a source depth (km).
The function return value
.I x
is a travel time for the named phase if positive, -1 if the phase name is
not known, and -2 if there are multiple arrivals for that phase (for example
P in the distance range of the 410 or 660 km discontinuity triplication).
On return, if
.IR X >0,
the return values
.I dtdd
and
.I dtdh
contain the slowness (sec/deg) and change in travel time with source depth
(sec/km).
.SS mtptt - return some or all arrivals
Called as a function by
.nf

      n = mtptt(\f2id\fP,\f2delta\fP,\f2depth\fP,\f2max\fP,\f2idphs\fP,\f2tt\fP,\f2dtdd\fP,\f2dtdh\fP)

.fi
where
.I id
is a phase name (generic such as ``P'' or all phases ``all''),
.I delta
is a distance (degrees),
.I depth
is a source depth (km), and
.I max
is the size of the arrays into which arrival information will be returned.
The function return value,
.IR n ,
gives the number of arrivals at that particular distance, and might be greater
than
.IR max ,
indicating that the return information was truncated.
If
.IR n <0,
the phase name wasn't recognized.
The return values,
.IR idphs ,
.IR tt ,
.IR dtdd ,
and
.I dtdh
are all arrays of size
.IR max .
.I idphs
is a character array (6 characters or larger per entry), whereas the rest
are arrays of real numbers.
On return each array entry contains a phase name
.RI ( idphs )
and corresponding travel time
.RI ( tt ),
slowness
.RI ( dtdd )
and change of travel time with source depth
.RI ( dtdh ).
.SS ntptt - return some or all arrivals
Called as a function by
.nf

      n = ntptt(\f2id\fP,\f2delta\fP,\f2depth\fP,\f2max\fP,\f2idphs\fP,\f2tt\fP,\f2dtdd\fP,\f2dtdh\fP,\f2d2dd2\fP)

.fi
Identical to mttpt except for the additional output parameter
.i dt2dd2
which returns the derivative of slowness with respect to range,
d/d(delta)[dt/d(delta)].
.EN
.SS txtb - return slowness, range and travel time for a single phase
Called as a subroutine by
.nf

      call txtb(\f2ph\fP,\f2depth\fP,\f2nmax\fP,\f2n\fP,\f2p\fP,\f2x\fP,\f2tt\fP)

.fi
where
.I ph
is a (character) phase name (including a branch name if relevant, such as
``SKSac''),
.I depth
is the source depth (km), and
.I nmax
is the capacity of the output arrays.
.IR p ,
.IR x ,
and
.IR tt ,
are output arrays (of size
.IR nmax ),
that contain the slowness (sec/deg), range (deg) and travel time (sec) of the
phase.
.I n
contains how many values were returned (which may be larger than
.I nmax
if the output was truncated).
.SS phnmg - return the generic arrival type of a specific branch name
The routines
.BR tptt ,
.B mtptt
and
.B ntptt
recognize generic phase names rather than specific branch names.
To strip a branch name from a string to make it generic, use
.B phnmg
as below:
.nf

      character*(\f2n\fP) phnmg
      str = phnmg(\f2id\fP)

.fi
The function return value
.I str
is a character string of length
.I n
with the input string
.I id
stripped of any branch name infixes or suffixes.
The calling program must declare the function to return strings of the desired
length
.IR n .
